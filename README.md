I153 final project

Freshmen and Sophomore college students in the US have the challenge to decide which major they want 
to focus on until graduation and what career to pursue but only have limited information and working 
experience necessary to make an informed decision. Our target user is freshman or sophomores already 
in college who have an idea of what they generally want to do. These people already know that they 
enjoy studying math, biology, English, or whatever subject, but they don’t know which specialized major
that they actually want to major in. This is a crucial problem that many students faced, as our interviewees
usually described choosing a major as difficult because of the multitude of related majors they could 
potentially pick. They haven’t been able to do research into the many different majors yet, so they 
still do not know. By developing this project, we seek to solve this problem that plagues so many young
undergraduates, as this is a crucial decision that can impact the rest of their professional careers.
